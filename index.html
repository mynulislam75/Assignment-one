        What psychologists say,it’s totally okay to replace love with food.
        If no one catches you eating it, then it has no calories. This, my friend, is the first rule of my diet.food is fuel.First, we eat. Then, we do everything else.Money won’t be able to buy happiness, but it can get you this delicious meal instead.My soul’s dark, I’m always bitter, and I’m too hot for you. Yup, I’m just like my favorite kind of coffee.Money won’t be able to buy happiness, but it can get you this delicious meal instead.Calories don’t count during the weekends.There’s absolutely no need for me to go to the gym. The name of the cashier at the Mcdonald’s I frequent is Jim, so same thing!

            We all know that the antioxidants in fruits and veggies work hard to protect your body from aging and disease. But what you may not know is that those antioxidants work even harder when they have the company of other antioxidants. That's why researchers recommend people eat 5 to 10 servings of a wide variety of different fruits and veggies every day.</p>
